# Introduction

In here, you'll find the IPython notebook code and data for our in-class presentation assignment regarding to basic statistic hypothesis testing.

The following questions were answered:
1. In the context of testing hypothesis about comparing means of two groups (females and males), bootstrap your data for comparing mean amount spent on the primary credit card last month" and debt to income ratio" for the two groups.
2. Explain how you can do hypothesis testing for comparing more than two groups. Select three groups from the dataset and explain how you use analysis of variance (ANOVA) for hypothesis testing comparing means of three groups
3. In most cases we compare means in the hypothesis testing, either means of groups or sample mean vs. population mean. Can we compare some other statistical properties in our hypothesis testing like population proportion or population variance?

In addition, we also conducted hypothesis testing in the form of A/B Testing using a mobile game to demostrate how it can be applied in web- and marketing scenarios.

## How to use the code

To open our code, you'll need to clone it to your local machine or to a cloud service with Jupyter Notebook (or similar).

The dataset for question 1-3 cand be found in: customer_dbase_sel.csv

The dataset for A/B Testing can be found in: cookie_cats.csv
