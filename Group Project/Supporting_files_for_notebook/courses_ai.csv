1,Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization,"For a lot of higher level courses in Machine Learning and Data Science, you find you need to freshen up on the basics in mathematics - stuff you may have studied before in school or university, but which was taught in another context, or not very intuitively, such that you struggle to relate it to how itâs used in Computer Science. This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science.

In the first course on Linear Algebra we look at what linear algebra is and how it relates to data. Then we look through what vectors and matrices are and how to work with them.

The second course, Multivariate Calculus, builds on this to look at how to optimize fitting functions to get good fits to data. It starts from introductory calculus and then uses the matrices and vectors from the first course to look at data fitting.

The third course, Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis, uses the mathematics from the first two courses to compress high-dimensional data. This course is of intermediate difficulty and will require Python and numpy knowledge.

At the end of this specialization you will have gained the prerequisite mathematical knowledge to continue your journey and take more advanced courses in machine learning.",https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning

But while there are many how-to courses for hands-on techies, there are practically none that also serve business leaders â a striking omission, since success with machine learning relies on a very particular business leadership practice just as much as it relies on adept number crunching.

This specialization fills that gap. It empowers you to generate value with ML by ramping you up on both the tech and business sides â both the cutting edge algorithms and the project management skills needed for successful deployment.

NO HANDS-ON AND NO HEAVY MATH. Rather than a hands-on training, this specialization serves both business leaders and burgeoning data scientists with expansive, holistic coverage.

BUT TECHNICAL LEARNERS SHOULD TAKE ANOTHER LOOK. Before jumping straight into the hands-on, as quants are inclined to do, consider one thing: This curriculum provides complementary know-how that all great techies also need to master. It guides you on the end-to-end process required to successfully deploy ML so that it delivers a business impact.

108,Machine Learning: Classification,"Case Studies: Analyzing Sentiment & Loan Default PredictionIn our case study on analyzing sentiment, you will create models that predict a class (positive/negative sentiment) from input features (text of the reviews, user profile information,...).  In our second case study for this course, loan default prediction, you will tackle financial data, and predict when a loan is likely to be risky or safe for the bank. These tasks are an examples of classification, one of the most widely used areas of machine learning, with a broad array of applications, including ad targeting, spam detection, medical diagnosis and image classification. 

In this course, you will create classifiers that provide state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks.  You will become familiar with  the most successful techniques, which are most widely used in practice, including logistic regression, decision trees and boosting.  In addition, you will be able to design and implement the underlying algorithms that can learn these models at scale, using stochastic gradient ascent.  You will implement these technique on real-world, large-scale machine learning tasks.  You will also address significant tasks you will face in real-world applications of ML, including handling missing data and measuring precision and recall to evaluate a classifier.  This course is hands-on, action-packed, and full of visualizations and illustrations of how these techniques will behave on real data.  We've also included optional content in every module, covering advanced topics for those who want to go even deeper! 

Learning Objectives: By the end of this course, you will be able to:
   -Describe the input and output of a classification model.
   -Tackle both binary and multiclass classification problems.
   -Implement a logistic regression model for large-scale classification.  
   -Create a non-linear model using decision trees.
   -Improve the performance of any model using boosting.
   -Scale your methods with stochastic gradient ascent.
   -Describe the underlying decision boundaries.  
   -Build a classification model to predict sentiment in a product review dataset.  
   -Analyze financial data to predict loan defaults.
   -Use techniques for handling missing data.
   -Evaluate your models using precision-recall metrics.
   -Implement these techniques in Python (or in the language of your choice, though Python is highly recommended).",https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification

151,Artificial Intelligence (AI) Education for Teachers,"Todayâs learners need to know what artificial intelligence (AI) is, how it works, how to use it in their everyday lives, and how it could potentially be used in their future. Using AI requires skills and values which extend far beyond simply having knowledge about coding and technology.This course is designed by teachers, for teachers, and will bridge the gap between commonly held beliefs about AI, and what it really is. AI can be embedded into all areas of the school curriculum and this course will show you how. 

This course will appeal to teachers who want to increase their general understanding of AI, including why it is important for learners; and/or to those who want to embed AI into their teaching practice and their studentsâ learning. There is also a unique opportunity to implement a Capstone Project for students alongside this professional learning course.
